## Introduction

Welcome to **PayNVoice**!

Prior to our development of this solution, traditional business transactions, invoicing, payments, and multi-party agreements are often time-consuming, prone to errors, and highly vulnerable to disputes. These processes therefore require constant manual input, third-party intermediaries like law enforcement agencies (Courts, Police officers etc), and this is due to the fact that it lacked transparency. Additionally, managing recurring payments, milestone-based projects, and multi-stakeholder agreements often involves complex and inefficient workflows.
